# Intro

I am a junior developer, a graduate computer science student in [New York University Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/computer-science-ms). Before NYU, I studied computer science at [Tongji University](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/main.htm). I love to try something new, interested in projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.
