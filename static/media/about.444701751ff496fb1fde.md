# Intro

I am a junior developer, a graduate student in [New York University Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/computer-science-ms). Before NYU, I studied computer science at [Tongji University](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/main.htm). I love to try something new, interested in projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.

# Some history

- I was born in China in 2001 and grew up in Shandong. When I was in elementary school, I took an extracurricular interest class in web design, which was the beginning of my exposure to computers.

- I finished my high school in Linzhi No.1 middle school in Tibet. In 2019, I was admitted to the university with the first place in science in Linzhi City.

- In the summer of 2019, I came to Tongji University studying computer science, where I started learning coding. I have to say it is really difficult for me at the beginning.

- In my sophomore and junior years, I minored in industrial design in Tongji University and got a certificate.

- In junior year, I did research in ADMIS Lab in Tongji University under the guidance of Dr. Wengen Li.

- In senior year, I did internship in Microsoft and NIO in Shanghai and finished my graduation project about gesture classification.
